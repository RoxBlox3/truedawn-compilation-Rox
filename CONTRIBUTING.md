#Contributions!
If you wish to help out with the project, you should try to adhere to the following points:
1. Build a branch from the branch you are wanting to edit.  This will often be first-dev.
2. If you want to change the primary scene at all, you MUST maintain regular communication to avoid merge conflicts.
3. If you are doing 3D models or textures, it is recommended that you build a separate scene specifically for showing it off.
  - This does not need to be complex, just show what you made with a general idea of where you wanted it.
  - The scene should be named:  "username-purpose-1"  for example: "tvoids-newdisplaypedestal-1"
4. If you are making scripts, try to stick to the Ideology that we are currently following.
  - This entails avoiding Monobehaviors where it makes sense and registering event listeners and handlers through SkillController when they pertain to skills.
